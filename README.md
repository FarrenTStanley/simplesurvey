This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Simple Survey is a React.js App that starts by accepting the users name then uses it to set the state of the greeting to include the name. There are 4 multiple choice questions(mainly about nerd stuff) which are all console logged and then submitted to a Firebase database using the Firebase API and imported UUID.
